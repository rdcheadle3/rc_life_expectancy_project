# Life Expectancy - Final Project

## Context

Conducted an exploratory visual analysis in Python and found connections between variables that seem worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, used various advanced analytical approaches to help test my hypotheses.

The results of your analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. 

## Objective

To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.

## Data
[Life Expectancy at Birth, Total (Years)](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators)

[COâ‚‚ and Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

[COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) OF CALORIC INTAKE](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS)

[CURRENT HEALTH EXPENDITURE (CHE) AS PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) (%)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-healthcare-expenditure-gdp)


## Process

Source open data, conduct exploratory analyses and develop hypotheses, conduct supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, perform a time series analysis, and create storyboard with interactive dashboards in tableau
